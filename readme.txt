Simple Tracers
---------------------------
An attempt at implementing a more subtle bullet tracer.
This also uses a basic 3D model to represent the bullet tracer.
May also not be very performant.

known issues:
 - shotguns sometimes produce wobbly bullet tracers for some reason
 - short-distance ricochets sometimes aren't handled properly

Credits:
 - angle/pitch code blatantly ripped from: https://github.com/swampyrad/HDBulletTracers/
 - also inspired by https://github.com/swampyrad/HDBulletTracers/
